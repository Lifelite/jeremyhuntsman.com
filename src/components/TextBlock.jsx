                    A Quality Engineer by profession, with a passion for creating and problem-solving deeply ingrained in my heart.

                    Whether you stumbled upon this website via LinkedIn, social media, or by sheer chance, I extend a warm welcome!<br/><br/>

                    I am currently employed as a Quality Engineer at Arvest Bank, and my enthusiasm for crafting, constructing, and tackling challenges extends beyond the confines of my professional life into my personal pursuits.

                    <br/><br/>This website serves as both a resume and a testament to my professional skills. I aspire not merely to be a Quality Engineer or a Developer but to transcend these roles.

                    My ardor lies in building, creating, and devising solutions for intricate problems, but above all, I am fueled by a love for continuous learning.
